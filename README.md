# Why was the app created
Someone in my family was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Patients with this condition need to constantly monitor their carbohydrates intake & expenditure in order to regulate blood sugar levels. Their family discovered right during the early days post the diagnosis that getting the most accurate carb count down to a gram was going to be challenging. Nutritional information available on food packets turned out to be not really precise/accurate for someone with a condition. There were instances when an unmentioned ingredient was found to be present in the packaged item and was affecting my niece's sugar levels to fluctuate considerably for a long time. They also found that it was difficult to get the nutritional value of some of the local ingredients & food items as they were not very popular outside the region. So they prepared their own database of 200+ items with their nutritional values. They use this list to calculate the carb count of each meal and administer insulin accordingly. This app is created as a handy calculator to reduce the manual effort it takes for them to get the carb count before each meal.
